Delicious Firefox Plugin
==========

ATM the src its a raw copy of the delicious firefox plugin, stuck at version at 2.3.4, and not compatible anymore with the new delicious api.
Really like delicious project, its my favourite way of organising ideas and TODOs, but its constantly changing owners so its quite a mess.
Been using if before YAHOOs adquisition, then sold to AVOS System, and currently in the hands of Science Inc (may, 2014)

Will try to fix this plugin, but on a tech-learning basis, so no serious productive xpi is expected
